# Visual Timer App
This is my project for Mobile Programmin course. The app is a countdown timer where you can choose a Pokemon to get color when timer runs in seconds. It offers better visual indication of time while your screen stays active. Completed timers are saved to calendar. Build with Expo, the app is designed to be cross-platform.
