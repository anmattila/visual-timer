# Visual Timer App
This is my project for Mobile Programmin course. The app is a countdown timer where you can choose a Pokemon to get color when timer runs in seconds. It offers better visual indication of time while your screen stays active. Completed timers are saved to calendar. Build with Expo, the app is designed to be cross-platform.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React Native and Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **UI-libraries**: React Native Paper, React Native Calendars, React Native Timer Picker
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage
- **Animation**: React Native Reanianimated
- **External Api**: PokeAPI

The plan is to build more features in the future. Have fun with the app!
